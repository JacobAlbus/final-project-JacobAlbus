	For my CS 126 final project, I plan on creating a turn-based, tile, strategy game. This would entail
creating, or finding somewhere online, art assets that would be used to display the game engine to the 
user. As for code, I woule likely to need to create extensible character, item, and board/map classes, as 
well as a display object which will be done in Cinder. There are likely many more classes and objects I 
will need to create, but I cannot think of any pertinent ones off of the top of my head right now. The 
game will likely just feature a series of battles the user can play through, but I would also like to add
a small and simply hub world as well as a basic story if time permits. 
	I chose this project because I have tried to do game design in the past but never got the full motivation
to fully complete it. I believe that my CS 126 grade is sufficient motivation for me. Furthermore, I specifically
chose a tile based game as it gives me much more control over player movement, something that I struggled with
in the past when I tried to allow for more free form movement. However, I believe that the project should still
be of significant challenge, especially if I make complex item/battle systems.
	By the end of the first week, I hope to have created a basic map and character class, allowing me to move
across a simple tiled board. By the end of the second week, I hope to have implemented items and a basic battle
system allowing me to actually create a full battle for the player to play through. By the end of my third week,
I hope to have created multiple battles, with dialogue, a hub world, and NPC's I can interact with.
